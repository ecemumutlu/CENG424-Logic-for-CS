# Changes:  
After `extract_facts.py` is run we follow up these changes.  
 - CORG capacity is decreased to 180 from 200  
 - 499 lecture hour increased to 3 from 1  

Instance files are:
    - `busy.lp`  
    - `courses.lp`    
    - `places.lp`  
    - `teaches.lp`  
    - `timeslots.lp`  

The optimization file is:
    - `timetabling.lp`   

The output file is:
    - `out.lp` -> This file should be manually copied from the output of `clingo --opt-mode=opt timetabling.lp > optimized.lp` to this file.
    - `schedule.xlsx` -> This file is generated by `tabularize_v2.py` which uses `out.lp` and `mapping.pickle` to generate the schedule.

One entry in the schedule.xlsx can be interpreted as:
    - COURSECODE_SECTION_ROOM_HOUR_INSTRUCTOR

Steps to execute:  
1. Execute `clingo --opt-mode=opt timetabling.lp > optimized.lp` to get the optimization results.  
2. The optimized answer is then copied inside the file called out.lp  
3. `python tabularize_v2.py "schedule.xlsx"` is run to generate the excel file for the desired output. NOTE: For this code to work there should be a mapping from time slots to integers and vice versa. Therefore mapping.pickle is required. This mapping.pickle object is dumped when the `extract_facts.py` is run over the problem_data.xlsx file to extract facts.
4. Open the schedule.xlsx to see the schedule.
